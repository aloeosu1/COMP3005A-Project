COMP3005A
Final Project V2

This is my final project for COMP3005A

Files included are:
  README.md

  Source files:
    member.py
    trainer.py
    admin.py
    main.py
  SQL:
    DDL.sql
    DML.sql

I was able to implement member functions: connectToDatabase(), register(), registerToDB(), login(), printInfo(), update(), viewMetrics, scheduleSession(), viewSession(),
viewExercises() and addExercise

As well as trainer functions connectToDatabase(), registerTrainer(), registerTrainerToDB(), login(), viewMember(), setAvail(), checkAvail() and viewSessions()

I was unable to implement all functions for members and trainers, and was only able to implement the register and login functions for admin before the deadline.

This was a fun and interesting project, and I will implement the remaining functions and functionality past the deadline for learning purposes.
